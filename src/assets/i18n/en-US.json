    "header-title": "HELLO, I’M SOFIA!",
    "header-description": "Did you know that it is possible to diagnose Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at 18 months of age? However, the average age at which a child receives the diagnosis is over 4 years, and it is even later for Black children, those from low-income families, and those living in rural areas.",

    "about-title": "ABOUT US",
    "about-description": "We are the AJA Group, consisting of Aline, Junior, and Amanda, students from Fatec Registro. Our goal is to contribute to SDG 3 – 'Good Health and Well-being.' With the rising rates of autism spectrum disorders, we decided to focus our studies on developing an innovative solution for this challenge during the Multiplatform Software Development course.",

    "proposal-title": "HOW IT <br> WORKS",
    "identification-title": "Identification of ASD <br> Signs",
    "identification-description": "It all starts with parents or guardians identifying the signs of ASD in the child. Then, they seek out a healthcare specialist.",

    "importance-title": "The Importance of <br> Professional Evaluation",
    "importance-description": "A qualified healthcare professional will use SOFIA to assist in the pre-diagnosis, ensuring greater effectiveness and accessibility.",

    "innovation-title": "Innovation with <br> Artificial Intelligence",
    "innovation-description": "Our app uses AI to analyze the completion of screening protocols and the child's demographic data to provide the result.",

    "research-title": "OUR DATA",
    "research-item1": "More than <em>60%</em> of children are diagnosed after the <em>age of 4</em>.",
    "research-item2": "<em>37%</em> of these children see more than 5 <em>doctors</em> before getting a final diagnosis.",
    "research-item3": "The main signs of ASD are <em>stereotypies</em> and <em>communication</em> disorders.",
    "research-item4": "<em>None of the doctors</em> interviewed used any software to aid in the diagnosis.",
    "research-item5": "However, all healthcare specialists <em>were familiar</em> with some virtual tools.",
    "research-item6": "<em>100%</em> of the respondents used their personal <em>phones</em> to assist during consultations.",

    "the-vale": "THE VALE DO RIBEIRA",
    "vale-description": "The Vale do Ribeira, located in the interior of SP/Brazil and composed of 22 municipalities, is a predominantly <em>rural</em> region. Applying the equivalence that 2.8% of the population is autistic (CDC), it is possible to calculate that there are more than <em>300 children</em> between the ages of 0 and 9 with the disorder in the region. Our goal is to make the pre-diagnosis of ASD more <em>accessible</em> for children in rural areas and with low socioeconomic status, such as in the Vale do Ribeira.",

    "future-title": "WANT TO HELP <em class='emphasis_pink'>SOFIA</em> IN THIS MISSION?",
    "future-description": "Although we are an academic project aimed at studying and developing a solution, we are very proud of our results! Our next steps consist of improving the SOFIA AI with a computer vision model to analyze stereotypies and adding new screening protocols to cover other age groups, continuing our focus on the pre-diagnosis of childhood ASD.",
